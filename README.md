# Yst is your screen tracker

Yst is a research-oriented program that lets you track whether participants are looking at a screen.
This is achieved by 
+ mounting a simple camera to the forehead of participants
+ marking the screen corners with Aruco stickers

In operation, Yst will detect the four screen corners and by their positions infer whether the participant is looking at the screen.
